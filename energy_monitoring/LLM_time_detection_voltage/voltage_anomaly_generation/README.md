## Introduction

We look into the vulnerabilities of ML algorithms in power systems, and craft specific attacks on power systems with different applications. 



## Usage

To exploit the algorithmic vulnerabilities, we consider the classification and forecasting case in power systems. Directly run the Python files and test the model accuracy before and after the attack.
